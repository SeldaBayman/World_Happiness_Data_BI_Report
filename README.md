# 🌍 World Happiness Report Dashboard (2015–2019)

This repository contains my detailed **Power BI dashboard** exploring global happiness trends across **2015, 2016, 2018, and 2019** using the World Happiness Report datasets.

## 📈 **Project Objective**

In this project, I aimed to uncover:
- How global happiness scores evolved over time.
- The relationship between GDP per Capita, Freedom, Healthy Life Expectancy, Generosity, Corruption Perception and overall Happiness Score.
- Which countries stand out with high income but moderate happiness.
- Regional differences and how Asia’s key players (e.g., Japan, Hong Kong) shifted in recent years.

## 🔍 **Key Insights**

✨ **Healthy Life Expectancy** shows a clear upward trend: **5.80 → 7.25**  
✨ **Freedom** peaked in 2018 but slightly dropped in 2019 — possibly due to early economic stress signals and the pandemic context.  
✨ **GDP per Capita** increased consistently from **7.99 → 9.05** (scaled data).  
✨ **Generosity** steadily declined, hinting at lifestyle shifts in an increasingly digital and individualistic world.  
✨ Countries like **Qatar, Luxembourg, Singapore** have extremely high GDP but only moderate Happiness Scores — proving that wealth alone doesn’t guarantee well-being.  
✨ Countries with the lowest perceived corruption include **Canada**, while top-ranked countries for freedom include **Sweden, Norway, Switzerland**.  
✨ **Japan & Hong Kong** showed upward momentum in Happiness Score and social support metrics in 2018–2019, signaling notable socio-economic improvements in East Asia.

## 🗂️ **Datasets Used**

- 📌 Source: [World Happiness Report on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- Separate CSV files for each year (2015, 2016, 2018, 2019)
- Merged and cleaned using **Power Query (M Code)** in Power BI

---

## ⚙️ **Tools & Methods**

- **Power BI Desktop**
- **Power Query (M Language)** for data cleaning:
  - Column transformations, data type corrections, regional formatting fixes
- **DAX** for calculated columns and KPI adjustments
- **Custom visuals**:
  - Bubble maps
  - Year-over-year KPI cards
  - Slicers for dynamic filtering
  - Trend lines and bar charts
- **Insight annotations** added for better storytelling

---

## ✅ **Main Dashboard Features**

- 📌 **Global Map View**: Countries visualized by Happiness Score and GDP per Capita
- 📌 **Year Slicer**: Easily compare metrics across years
- 📌 **Key KPIs**: Healthy Life Expectancy, Freedom, GDP per Capita, Generosity, Perception of Corruption, Social Support
- 📌 **Regional Focus**: Highlights notable shifts in Asia (Japan, Hong Kong)

## 🧩 **Why This Matters**

This project shows that **happiness is multidimensional**: income is not the sole driver. Social freedom, healthy life conditions, trust in government, and generosity all shape how people perceive their quality of life.

For example:
- Some Gulf countries have extremely high GDP but score moderate on happiness due to possible constraints on freedom or social factors.
- Scandinavian countries consistently rank high in freedom and happiness, despite GDP per Capita not always being the highest.
- The post-2018 slight drop in global freedom scores could foreshadow socio-political challenges leading into the pandemic years.
